# Digispark-ATtiny85
The ATtiny85 is a microcontroller in a similar vein to the Arduino, but with much less IO pins, smaller memory and a smaller form factor

# What can I do with it?
The short answer is, if you can do it with an Arduino, then it is highly likely that it can be done with the ATtiny85. From simple LEDs flashing, to WS2812B multicolour LED strings, to elaborate sensor projects, the ATtiny85 can do it, and with a cloned board retailing for around $2, there is no excuse to try one out.

# Simple project
