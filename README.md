# Digispark-ATtiny85
The ATtiny85 is a microcontroller in a similar vein to the Arduino, but with much less IO pins, smaller memory and a smaller form factor

# What can I do with it?
 The short answer is, if you can do it with an Arduino, then it is highly likely that it can be done with the ATtiny85. From simple LEDs flashing, to WS2812B multicolour LED strings, to elaborate sensor projects, the ATtiny85 can do it, and with a cloned board retailing for around $2, there is no excuse to try one out.
# How to use
**1. Pair with the Arduino IDE**
  - Install the Arduino IDE
  - Navigate to the Arduino IDE ATtiny microcontroller support GitHub page
  - Follow the instructions to add this new feature 
  - Once properly installed, navigate to Tools > Board on the Arduino IDEs, and you'll see a pair of selections listed under ATtiny Microcontrollers.

# Simple project
